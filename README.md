# Bank_ATM_Account_Manager

<p>This was my first Java GUI application, simulating an ATM/Bank Account Manager. Users can create or sign into an account to view/update their balances.</p>
<p>This is in no way a complete project; there are several known bugs, passwords are stored in plain text, accounts are just free floating .txt files stored in the root directory, etc.</p>
<p>However, being my first project done in Java in just 2 sittings, I'm proud of what I was able to do at that point in my programming education</p>
