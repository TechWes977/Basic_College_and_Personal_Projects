# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization
#This was my final project for my first Object Oriented Programming class. I created a system where a user can sign in, or create an account to view their balance, make deposits and withdrawals, and change their stored password.  This was created before I knew how to implement databases, so stored account information is saved as .txt file in the same directory the project is run from. The .txt files are automatically created when a user goes through the "create a new account" process. The account's information is stored: Username (as the .txt file name), First and Last Name, password, and account balance.  If I redid this project today, I would instead use a database to store information, and I would also encrypt the passwords. This being said, I am very proud of this project, and believe it showcased my ingenuity, creativeness, and eagerness to go above and beyond project expectations. This was one of my first times implementing a simple, native GUI, and I believe it showcases my progress nicely.
